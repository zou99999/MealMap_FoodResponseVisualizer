      <h1>Therefore, Are you curious of what type of meal is healthier for you? <br> And what happens to your body after having such a meal? <br> Let's check it out!</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>Why Sugar, Protein, and Calories?</h3>
      <p>
        Sugar, protein, and calorie content are key factors that influence glucose response:
        sugar typically drives sharp spikes, protein can help stabilize it, and total calories provide context.
      </p>
      <p>
        By connecting these nutrients to glucose trends, we give users a clearer picture of how different
        meals affect their energy, focus, and long-term health.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Why Glucose?</h3>
      <p>
        Glucose is one of the most revealing signals your body gives you.  
        When we eat, our bodies break food into nutrients — and carbohydrates become glucose,
        a form of sugar that fuels everything from your brain to your muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some meals trigger rapid spikes and crashes, leaving you tired, hungry, or unfocused. Others give steady energy, less craving, better mood.
        By visualizing glucose trends, we get a real-time window into how food affects us.
      </p>
  
      <p class="glucose-note">
        Everyone’s glucose response is different — depending time of day, gut microbiome,
        stress, sleep, and even food combinations. We are not judging what food is "bad", only exploring:
        <em>How does this meal tend to affect the body — and could it affect you similarly?</em>

    <h2>👀 How Your Heart Reacts After Eating</h2>

      While blood sugar often peaks around 30–45 minutes after a meal, 
      let’s see how your heart rate usually fluctuates in that same window.
      Notice if there’s a sympathetic “spike” as you digest.

    <h1>🍽️ Key Takeaways</h1>
    <ul class="takeaway-list">
      <li><strong>Monitor your response.</strong> Keep an eye on your glucose and heart–rate curves after meals.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose steady meals.</strong> Meals that avoid sharp glucose spikes reduce risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance macros.</strong> Pair carbs with protein and fiber to slow absorption and stabilize energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Get personalized advice.</strong> Talk to a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to you.</li>
    </ul>

      Stay mindful—your body’s reaction to each meal is the first step toward long-term health!
