      Or if you’re like us -- always debating what to eat -- input your desired nutrient levels,<br> we will get you a close-match recommendation, and show the glucose aftermath.<br>

      <h2>But, Smoothie may Mot be a healthy option !</h2>
      <p>A 20 fl oz. smoothies made with spinach, celery, and banana has about 404 calories, 60g of sugar, and 14g of protein.</p>
      <p>A piece of cake and a cup of ice cream has about 535 calories, 56g of sugar, 6.6g of protein.</p>
      <p>With less calories and similar sugar content, the smoothie can raise your glucose over 160 mg/dL !</p>

      <h2>Why Sugar, Protein, and Calories?</h2>
      <p>
        Sugar, protein, and calorie content are key factors that influence glucose response:
        sugar typically drives sharp spikes, protein can help stabilize it, and total calories provide context.
      </p>
      <p>
        By connecting these nutrients to glucose trends, we give users a clearer picture of how different
        meals affect their energy, focus, and long-term health.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Why Glucose?</h2>
      <p>
        Glucose is one of the most revealing signals your body gives you.  
        When we eat, our bodies break food into nutrients — and carbohydrates become glucose,
        a form of sugar that fuels everything from your brain to your muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some meals trigger rapid spikes and crashes, leaving you tired, hungry, or unfocused. Others give steady energy, less craving, better mood.
        By visualizing glucose trends, we get a real-time window into how food affects us.
      </p>
  
      <p class="glucose-note">
        Everyone’s glucose response is different — depending time of day, gut microbiome,
        stress, sleep, and even food combinations. We are not judging what food is "bad", only exploring:
        <em>How does this meal tend to affect the body — and could it affect you similarly?</em>

    <h2>👀 How Your Heart Reacts After Eating</h2>
    <p>
      While blood sugar often peaks around 30–45 minutes after a meal, 
      let’s see how your heart rate usually fluctuates in that same window.
      Notice if there’s a sympathetic “spike” as you digest.
