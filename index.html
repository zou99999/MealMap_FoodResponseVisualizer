    <h3>Why These Nutrients?</h3>
    <p>Sugar, protein, and calories are the three key nutrients that shape your body’s glucose response after a meal.</p>
    <p>Sugar tends to cause sharp spikes. Protein helps slow down that rise. Calories provide overall context — bigger meals, bigger waves.</p>

<!-- SECTION 2c.3 — Why Glucose Matters -->
<section id="section2c3" class="hero-section fade-section">
  <div class="hero-content">
    <h3>Why Glucose?</h3>
    <p>Glucose is one of the clearest signals your body gives you after eating. Carbs turn into glucose — your body’s fuel for muscles, mood, and brainpower.</p>
    <p><b>Spikes</b> can leave you foggy, tired, and craving more. <br><b>Steady curves</b>That’s why we visualize it.</p>
    <p class="glucose-note">
      Everyone’s response is unique<br> — it depends on sleep, stress, time of day, microbiome, and more.<br>
      This isn’t about good vs. bad food — just asking:<br>
      <em><b>What does this meal tend to do? Might it affect you similarly?</b></em>

    <h2>👀 How Your Heart Reacts After Eating</h2>
    <p>
      While blood sugar often peaks around 30–45 minutes after a meal, 
      let’s see how your heart rate usually fluctuates in that same window.
      Notice if there’s a sympathetic “spike” as you digest.

    <h1>🍽️ Key Takeaways</h1>
    <ul class="takeaway-list">
      <li><strong>Monitor your response.</strong> Keep an eye on your glucose and heart–rate curves after meals.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose steady meals.</strong> Meals that avoid sharp glucose spikes reduce risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance macros.</strong> Pair carbs with protein and fiber to slow absorption and stabilize energy.</li>
      <li><strong>Get personalized advice.</strong> Talk to a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to you.</li>

      Stay mindful—your body’s reaction to each meal is the first step toward long-term health!
